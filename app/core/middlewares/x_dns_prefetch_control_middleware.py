class XDNSPrefetchControlMiddleware:

    """

    ASGI middleware that adds the X-DNS-Prefetch-Control header to all HTTP responses.

    This header controls browser DNS prefetching, which can improve performance but may
    have privacy implications by leaking information about links a user might click.

    Primary Category: Legacy Header
    Sub-Category: Browser/Client Focused
    Reason for inclusion: Provides a privacy enhancement by disabling a browser feature that could potentially leak user navigation patterns to DNS servers.

    Note that this middleware only handles HTTP requests and is implemented in ASGI manner for consistency and to avoid silent failures.

    
    Usage
    -----
    ```python
    app.add_middleware(XDNSPrefetchControlMiddleware, policy="off")
    ```

    """

    def __init__(self, app: ASGIApp, policy: str = "off") -> None:

        """

        Initialize the middleware with the given ASGI application.

        
        Parameters
        ----------

            The ASGI application to wrap.
        
        policy : str
            The DNS prefetch policy.
                The options are:
                    `"on"`
                        Enable DNS prefetching.
                    `"off"`
                        Disable DNS prefetching.
