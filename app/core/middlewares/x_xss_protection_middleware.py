class XXSSProtectionMiddleware:

    """

    ASGI middleware that adds the X-XSS-Protection header to all HTTP responses.

    This header was used to control the built-in reflective XSS auditor in older browsers.
    Modern browsers have removed this feature in favor of Content-Security-Policy.

    Primary Category: Legacy Header
    Sub-Category: Browser/Client Focused
    Reason for inclusion: This header provides a minimal, last-resort fallback against some reflective XSS attacks for users on very old browsers that do not support Content-Security-Policy. It should be set to disable the auditor (`0`) or enable block mode (`1; mode=block`).

    Note that this middleware only handles HTTP requests and is implemented in ASGI manner for consistency and to avoid silent failures.

    
    Usage
    -----
    ```python
    app.add_middleware(XXSSProtectionMiddleware)
    ```

    """

    def __init__(self, app: ASGIApp, policy: str = "0") -> None:

        """

        Initialize the middleware with the given ASGI application.
