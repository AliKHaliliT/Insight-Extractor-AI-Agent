class XDownloadOptionsMiddleware:

    """

    ASGI middleware that adds the X-Download-Options header to all HTTP responses.

    This is a legacy, IE-specific header that forces the browser to prompt the user to
    save a file, rather than opening it directly in the browser, mitigating some phishing attacks.

    Primary Category: Legacy Header
    Sub-Category: Browser/Client Focused
    Reason for inclusion: Provides a specific security enhancement for users on Internet Explorer 8 and newer, preventing HTML files from being executed in the context of the site.

    Note that this middleware only handles HTTP requests and is implemented in ASGI manner for consistency and to avoid silent failures.

    
    Usage
    -----
    ```python
    app.add_middleware(XDownloadOptionsMiddleware)
    ```

    """

    def __init__(self, app: ASGIApp) -> None:
